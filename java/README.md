1 and 2 were "experiment" programs created to test the efficiency of specific algorithms.
1. Tests the efficiency of binary search vs ternary search. Also incorporates merge sort to sort any given array.
2. The original assignment had something to do with storing 2500 "code names" of some sort. Tests the efficiency of double hashing vs quadratic probing. Requires "test.txt" to run.

3. I believe this was a solution for a question in a part of a programming competition that was done in high school. Word cyphers??? I do not remember the year, nor do I remember the name of the contest. Whoops.
4. Checks whether or not an input string is a palindrome.
5. A tic-tac-toe game that is played solely through the console. One requirement was also to add an file i/o thing for ASCII pictures.
