This was a game I made for the final project in my final Grade 12 computer science class.
I wanted to make a "helicopter" inspired game as it would be relatively simple to design and code.
All graphics were also created by me.

The last part I wanted to implement was a high score page but I don't believe I had enough time during the project to make it work properly. As it is, I believe it's bugged and only saves either the highest score or the first input score. I don't quite remember.
